Century Pay is a **Discord bot** designed to simplify on-chain payments. Users can effortlessly connect their wallets and perform transactions using simple Discord commands. Whether it's sending ETH, accessing a faucet, or staking ETH for the ETHGlobal hackathon, Century Pay streamlines the process.

Thanks to the integration with **AA wallets**, on-chain interactions have never been easier. Users can sign in securely with a passkey, and their gas fees will be covered by a paymaster. When interactions require sending valuesâ€”such as voting or minting NFTsâ€”the bot provides clear guidance to help users navigate smart contract interactions seamlessly!

## Architecture

-   [ðŸ“„ contracts](./contracts): Example voting smart contracts. It allows users to create vote session, vote and tally.
-   [ðŸŽ¯ server](./server): The server of the Century Pay discord bot. It handles the commands from users and gives responses.
-   [ðŸ§© web](./web): Century Pay's website. Since the users cannot execute javascript or any other code execution in discord, Century Pay bot redirects users to the website to sign and send transactions with their own wallets.

## Technology

1. [Alchemy Embedded Accounts](https://aa-sdk-site-alpha.vercel.app/react/quickstart): Alchemy provides AA accounts infrastructure and its gas master. It allows users to send transaction without having ETH at first.
2. [Base smart wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet/smart-wallet): It is one of the AA accounts infrastructure. It allows users to create an smart wallet easily.
3. [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/): We use the wallet connect frontend components to let users connect their own wallets. It supports many networks and many wallets.
4. [Blockscout](https://www.blockscout.com/): Blockscout makes users' transactions more visible and clear in this app and it supports multiple chains.
5. [Discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro): The discord bot is used to handle the requests and send responses to users.
6. [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/): It handles user's data and connect the discord bot and the Century Pay website.

## Future work

-   **Universal transaction**

    -   Now we only implement the payment and vote, but it can be extended to

        1. transfer ERC20 tokens or NFT token
        2. interact with different smart contracts
        3. deploy smart contracts

        that transactions needs users' signatures

-   **General push notification**

    -   Now the server only listens to specific events. But it can be extended to many others. And ideally we want the users can be notified by all the transactions happening on each chain.

-   **In-app wallet connection**

    -   Discord only supports text, button, links... in the chatroom, and it _cannot perform computation_ before sending commands. We cannot connect to a secured wallet in the discord app. If Discord can support javascript computation in chatroom, we don't need to redirect users to frontend wallet website.

-   **Purchase and exchange tokens**
    -   We can connect like Apple pay to let users buy tokens within Discord
    -   And users can exchange assets within Discord
